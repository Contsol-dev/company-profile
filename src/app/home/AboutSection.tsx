        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-sm md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Cont Solution was established in 2023. Initially, we focused on
          providing task assistance related to computer science, developing
          systems for Student Creativity Programs (PKM), and creating other
          systems needed by students to execute their creative ideas. Helping
          students has been a proud moment for us. As we evolve to improve, we
          adapt to accommodate the needs of our clients.
